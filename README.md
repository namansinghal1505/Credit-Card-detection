# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Networks

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a neural network model trained on the popular Kaggle dataset. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so appropriate techniques like resampling were used to balance the classes before training.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Samples**: 284,807 transactions
- **Fraud cases**: ~0.17% only

---

##  Model Overview

- **Architecture**: Fully Connected Neural Network (Keras Sequential API)
- **Techniques used**:
  - Data normalization (RobustScaler for `Amount`, MinMax for `Time`)
  - Class balancing (undersampling of non-fraudulent data)
  - Early stopping and model checkpointing
